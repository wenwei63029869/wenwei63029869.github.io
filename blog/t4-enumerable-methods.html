        There are so many methods that go with enumerable module. Select method is probably one of the most useful and basic ones. Therefore, there are a lot of other methods that derived from select. In this blog, we are going to talk about group_by, a method that organize selected elements.
    </p>
    <p class="blogbody">
        A group_by operation on an enumerable object takes a block and returns a hash. The block is executed for each object. For each unique block return value, the result hash gets a key; the value for that key is an array of all the elements of the enumerable for which the block returned that value. In the example below, the method iterate all the integers within range from 0 to 6, the results will be divided into groups of values in term of reminder from i%3 which become the keys.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    (1..6).group_by { |i| i%3 }
    #=> {0=>[3, 6], 1=>[1, 4], 2=>[2, 5]}
    </code></pre>
    <p class="blogbody">
         The partition method is similar to group_by, but it splits the elements of the enumerable into two arrays based on whether the code block returns true for the element. Thereâ€™s no hash, just an array of two arrays. The two arrays are always returned in true/false order. As the example shown below, partition iterates the range from 1 to 6 and returns an array that contains two arrays based on true or false from the block. Therefore, [2, 4, 6] is true for the v.even? and [1, 3, 5] is false.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    (1..6).partition { |v| v.even? }
    #=> [[2, 4, 6], [1, 3, 5]]
    </code></pre>
