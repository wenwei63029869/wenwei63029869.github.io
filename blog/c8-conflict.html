        <h2>Conflict Solving</h2>
        <h6>By <name>Wei Wen</name> on September 18, 2016.</h6>

        <p>
            When I was doing a group project, I had a conflict with another teammember on if our business model should be monthly subcription or one time signup fee. We both had reasonable reasons. I argued that one time signup fee which was going to be higher would stop potential customers from trying out our product in the first place. His reason was that customers could cancel the subscription anytime. It would be better to secure the revenue upfront. Later, we started to do name calling and our meeting had to stop because the rest of the team didn't want to waste time to listen to us arguing.
        </p>
        <p>
            The superficial reason that we had the conflict was our different opinions on business model. However, the real cause was that my teammate couldn't really listen to other people's opinions. Every time someone brough up an opinion different from his, he would simply disagree. He might have good reaons behind that, but his attitude made people feel like he didn't respect other people's opinions. When I felt angry upon analyzing the conflict.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order not to jeopardize our project, I met with the person in private and told them how his reaction made me feel that my opinions disrespected even though he didn't really mean it. I also told him what I wanted was contributing for the team and there was nothing personal. If I accidently made him feel disrespected, I didn't mean it at all. Therefore, we got back to the meeting room and focus on the business issue.
        </p>
        <p>
            If I could do it again, I would certainly not do name calling. That is disrespectful and unprofessional. It does nothing but made the situation worse. Instead, as soon as I felt like we were not talking about the problem but getting personal, I should try bringing us back to the issue. If that doesn't work, I will call off the meeting and discuss with the person outside of the meeting. More than often, people don't argue for the rigth thing but for their authority when in front of others.
        </p>
        <p>
            I think the best trick to solve conflict is not to focus on conflict itself. Instead, we should focusing on what causes teh conflict and how to solve that.
