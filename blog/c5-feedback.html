        <h2>My Pairing Experience</h2>
        <h6>By <name>Wei Wen</name> on August 28, 2016.</h6>

        <p>
            It is my 5th week in DBC already and I just finished my 10th pairing session. In this article, I am going to talk about how my pairing experience is like and how to take advantage of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            So far, I have tried to pair with different people each time. The experiences and results are various, and they can be divide into two types. First type is I am moving faster than my parter. It means that I am always leading the thought process and explaining thing. My partner is just going alone with it. In this kind of pairing session, it is not really like we are learning from each other. Even though I got to practice how to express my thoughts clearly, it would much longer to finish the challnge because I had to explain everything. The other type is that I am slower than my partner. In this situation, I couldn't keep up, so my partner had to slow down and explain the process to me. Sometimes, I would get frustrated and become even slower. Therefore, I really appreciate my partner's patient. Also, because I know how it feels to be the slow one in a pair, I always tried to be patient and make sure we are moving forward together.
        </p>

            I think I am very luck that most feedback that I have received is positive. Besides that their compliments make me happy, I am glad that they have gotten a positive pairing experience with me. In addition, their feedback confirm what practice I should keep. On the other hand, I also recieved constructive advice. I, now, understand how important it is for feedback to be kind, actionable, and specific. Maybe it would make me feel a little bit uncomfortable, but I didn't feel frustrated because I know exactly how I could make an improvement. For example, one feedback says that I waste too much time on typing command line. Then it suggests me to look up online for shortcuts and pratice them. As a result, I know exactly what do to improve that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Overall, I think pairing sessions are great for learning how to work in team. Nonethe less, for me, I prefer to work on challenges that would take longer time to finish on my own. It is probably because the challenges we are dealing with now are not too complicated, so I don't really see the obvious benefit of team working now. I am looking forward to paring sessions on more complicated challenges in the future.
