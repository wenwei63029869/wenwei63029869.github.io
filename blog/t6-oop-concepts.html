        When we first learn ruby, we hear classes very often. However, what we don't know is that classes have a brother called modules. They are very similar but very different at the same time. In this article, we will discuss about the similarities and differences between them.
    </p>
    <p class="blogbody">
        Let's first start from the simple one - modules. Here are some key points about modules.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>A Ruby file with some functions or variables in it inside a module .. end block.</li>
      <li>You import that file.</li>
      <li>And you can access the functions or variables in that module with the . (dot) operator.</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="blogbody">
          Now imagine I have a module called "mything.rb" and I put a function in it called "list." Besides, I can call put a variable in it too.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
          # this goes in mything.rb
          module MyThing
            def MyThing.list()
                puts "You have nothing here!"
            end
            TANGERINE = "You have to put something in it"
          end
    </code></pre>
    <p class="blogbody">
         Once I have the code set up, I import the file and call the function and variable as shown below.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
          require "./mything.rb"
          MyThing.list()
          puts MyThing::TANGERINE
    </code></pre>
    <p class="blogbody">
          After we are clear what modules are, let's move on to classes. The official explanation for classes is that a class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. However, there is a simplier explanation: a class is a way to take a grouping of functions and data and place them inside a container so you can access them with the "." operator. Therefore, it serves a similiar purpose as a module. From the example below, you will able to see the similaity.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
          class MyThing

            def initialize()
                @tangerine = "You have to put something in it"
            end

            attr_reader :tangerine

            def list()
                puts "You have nothing here!"
            end

          end
    </code></pre>
    <p class="blogbody">
          Then, instead of requiring a file like for modules, you need to instantiate an object. With that object, you will be able to use everything inside of the class that it belongs to.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
          thing = MyThing.new()
          thing.list()
          puts thing.tangerine
    </code></pre>
    <p class="blogbody">
          The output will be identical. However, most programmers would choose using classes over modules. The reason is scalability. You can use take a class and make many of them, and they won't interfere with each other. However, when you import a module, you can only run one for the entire program, which means it is way less flexible.
    </p>
    <p class="blogbody">
          Great! Now that you know what classes and modules are, you should know when to use which next time.
