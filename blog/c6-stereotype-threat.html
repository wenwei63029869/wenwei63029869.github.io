        Stereotype threat refers to being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. It can potentially cause people underperform in academic or professional lives. It can be caused by ethnicity, gender, age, etc. The worst part is that many people don't even realized the stereotype threat that they have. Therefore, we will talk about some examples of stereotype threat and how they are going to undermine performance.

        According to Dr. Claude Steele, a social psychologist feeling under threat leads you to believe that something bad could happen based on an identity you have. This anxiety often manifests itself in psychological and physiological ways, including distraction, increased body temperature and increased heart rate, all of which diminish performance levels. That is proved by an experiment where a group of black and white students was divides into two groups with the same numbers of black and white participants to an identical exam. One group was told that the exam could measure IQ. The outcome was that white students outperformed black studets overall. For the other group, they were not told anything about testing measuring IQ. The outcome was unexpected. White students' exam results were similar to the black students'. By Dr. Claude Steel, because the stereotype is that black students are less smart than other ethnicities, the stress from stereotype threat caused black students underperform.

        After I get to know more about stereotype threat, I realize that I actually experienced that before too. Since I am not a English native speaker, I always think that I would not be as good at public speaking as native speakers. Even though I have no problem communicating with a group of people in English, I often stumble in presentation or any kinds of events that requires public speaking skill. Now I think back, everytime I needed to do a presentation, my professors would emphasize that the presentation would help them to evaluate my public speaking skill. The internal steretypo threat would create anxiety, which caused me repeating myself, forgeting words, etc.. Gradually, those bad presentations convinced me that there is no way that a non-native speaker can have the equally good public speaking skill as an native speaker. Then I just gave up on practicing my public speaking.

        I already take the first step and the most important step to get rid of stereotype thread - acknowledging the stereotype. Next, I will at least try to ignore the stereotype, so I can perform at my true level. Also, I will try to find out if there are any other sterertype threads that I have and defeat them.
