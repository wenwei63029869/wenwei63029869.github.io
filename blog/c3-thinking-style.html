        My thinking style is abstract sequential. According to Anthony Gregorc, a phenomenological researcher, lecturer, consultant, author and President of Gregorc Associates, Inc.:

    <h4 id="c3_list_title">Abstract sequential learner likes:</h6>
      <li>his/her point to be heard</li>
      <li>analyzing situations before making a decision or acting</li>
      <li>applying logic in solving or finding solutions to problems</li>

    <h4 id="c3_list_title">What's hard for them?</h6>

      <li>Being forced to work with those of differing views</li>
      <li>Too little time to deal with a subject thoroughly</li>
      <li>Repeating the same tasks over and over</li>
      <li>Lots of specific rules and regulations</li>
      <li>"sentimental" thinking</li>
      <li>Expressing their emotions</li>
      <li>Being diplomatic when convincing others</li>
      <li>Not monopolizing a conversation</li>

        I think this description is very accurate. I do have had some of the difficulties mentioned above. When it comes to a pairing session, sometimes I feel like getting straight into the solution if I know how to solve the problem. It frustrates me sometimes that I have to wait for my teammate to fully understand the problem and approach. Therefore, I might try to dictate the conversation and rush to the solution directly without listening to my partner’s opinion. However, I realize that very often my partner could give some very good insights. For example, when I was pairing with another person in week 1. He taught me couple of comment line tricks that are very useful to save time. Therefore, from now on, I will force myself to always ask my partner’s opinions after I express mine.

        I do find that with step-by-step instruction and experts, I can learn so much better. Therefore, I will set a goal to myself: I will attend office hours at least once per week.
