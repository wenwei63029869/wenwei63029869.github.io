        Based on the video, I have three takes on the DBC experience. First, we are not expected to just learn and leave in DBC. Instead, we are expected to contribute to the community and help it to improve.  Secondly, we should be able to admit our ignorance. Only in this way, we will feel comfortable to ask questions and that’s best way to learn. Thirdly, we are expected to learn from everyone in the community through different kinds of pairing exercises and social media tools. Also, we will learn to how to communicate with teammates about our opinions precisely.

        My impression of DBC is that it is not merely teaching the students how to code but also how to think like an engineer and to work in a team. I think this kind of culture is what I am looking for at a coding boot camp. That’s why I chose DBC in the first place. I had worked with engineers before and I have always had a problem communicate with engineers. I think I will try to learn and practice as DBC goes. Right now, at least I think I am not ashamed of asking for help. Of course, I will try my best to find the answers on my own if it is possible. Also, I will try my best to help out other people whenever I can. Last but not least, I will be excited about every week’s challenges because it is my opportunity to learn new things.

        I am very excited to participate in this kind of learning environment. In DBCI feel confident about starting this journey when I know there are so many people whom I can look for help from Surely, it is inevitable to be a little bit nervous at the beginning, but I believe that it will fade away as the boot camp goes.
