        Chanllenge is very important to me because that's what pushes me keep moving forward in my life. Without challenges, life will be too boring for me. That said, challenges are always there, but it is up to you if you take them or not. I am just a person of the group that likes to take on challenges.

        The last time I was asked for advice on is about if he should take easy A classes to maintain high GPA or hard classes that he is really interested in. It related to one of the values that I care the most - challenges. Like I said before, challenges are always there, it depends if you are going to take them. In my friend's situation, he could definitely choose the high way. However, he would probably spend a whole semester on something that he is not interested at all. However, if he takes the hard way, he is alway able to spend the a part of his life to do what he is really interested in. He might probably get a good grade as taking the easy class. Not to mention that he gains way more than just grade from the class.

        Whenever I think of my values, I would be able to transfer my attention from on the difficulty I am going through to on the fact that I am able to live up to my values. I know that it might be very harsh at this moment, but someday in the future I will not regret the choice I make today (or I will regret in the future if I give up today). Another method I use very often is to think about why I am doing what I am doing right now and what is the ultimate goal. By doing so, I will pay attention on my goal instead of the difficulties I encounter at the moment.
