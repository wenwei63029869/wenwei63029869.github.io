        After four weeks of learning Ruby, we start to learn Javascript this week. Surprisingly, Javascript and Ruby have a lot of similarity. Very often, there is a thing sharing the same functionality in both languages but with different names. However, it would be a big mistake to assume that everything is the same in both languages just with different names. Next, I am going to talk about one the most easiest to be confused terms - Ruby classes and Javascript constructor function.
    </p>
    <p class="blogbody">
        Firstly, as you may already know, in Ruby a class is the blueprint from which individual objects are created. In other words, we can think of a class as a factory. The product -- objects get produced from a class and stored there. If you want to know more about Ruby classes, you can read my previous blog on this subject (<a href="http://wenwei63029869.github.io/blog/t5-ruby-classes.html">It Is All About Classes</a>). Below is an example of how to use class.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
    class Cake
      def initialize(size, flavor)  #=> Constructor function
        @size = size  #=> Instance variable
        @flavor = flavor
      end

      def size  #=> reader function
        @size
      end

      def flavor  #=> reader function
        @flavor
      end
    end

    cheese_cake = Cake.new(10, "cheese")  #=> A new class instance is created
    cheese_cake.size  #=> return 10
    cheese_cake.flavor  #=> return "cheese"
    </code></pre>
    <p class="blogbody">
        Similarly, in Javascript, constructor function is a blue print to create objects. Therefore, the new object will inherit everything from its constructor function. In the example shown below, you will see how to set up a constructor function and create new objects from it.
    </p>
    <pre><code>
        function Goldbag(posX, posY) {
          this.posX = posX;
          this.posY = posY;
        }

        var goldBag1 = new Goldbag(Math.random()*50 + 1, Math.random()*50 + 1)
        var goldBag2 = new Goldbag(Math.random()*50 + 1, Math.random()*50 + 1)
        var goldBag3 = new Goldbag(Math.random()*50 + 1, Math.random()*50 + 1)
    </code></pre>
    <p class="blogbody">
         If you pay attention, you should see that the constructor function is very similar to initialize function in class which happens to be called constructor function as well. Therefore constructor functiion in Javascript only does part of what a class does in Ruby. If you ever want to add function to all the same type of objects (like instance method in Ruby), you will need to prototype. Here is an article about prototype in Javascript: <a href="https://github.com/raganwald/javascript-allonge/blob/master/manuscript/markdown/Ideas/prototype.md">How Prototypes and Constructors differ from Classes</a>. Another difference is that a class is actually an instance of another class while a constructor function is not. Therefore, a class will have methods inherited from its super class, while constructor function doesn't have any super class to inherit methods from.

          Even though different programming languages have a lot in common in terms of logic, it would be better not to simply think that they are just different syntactically by overlooking the fundamental differences.
