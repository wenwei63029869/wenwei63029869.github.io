        <h2>Online Security</h2>
        <h6>By <name>Wei Wen</name> on August 21, 2016.</h6>

        <p>
            As more and more peopel get access to Internet, online security has become a more and more serious issue. Recently, online cheating website <span>Ashley Madison</span> got hacked and huge amount of sensitive user information are revealed. With more and more personal information input into the Net, users are the same as naked if those information get stolen. Therefore, ensuring online security is the key for more people to take advantage of Internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            So what doesn it mean when we hear that a website is being hacked? If a website is hacked, the hacker has access to the website's database, which means that he can see all the information including who you have dated in Ashley Madison's case. There are many ways to hack a website. One of the most simplest (or low level) one is SQL injection. It involves entering SQL code into web forms, eg. login fields, or into the browser address field, to access and manipulate the database behind the site, system or application. For example, in the login page, if you type 'OR 1=1-- in username field, the authorization routine is now validated.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course, this simple method only works when the website is extremely poorly coded. As a matter of fact, most web scripting languages have functions that you can pass a string through to avoid the leak. The point is that it does not nessary take a military-grade of achtectrue to prevent a SQL injection. If you want to get a more throughout overview on online security, you can visit this website below:

            One possible solution to inprove online security is combining the advantages of boardband and phone modem. One advantage of accessing Internet through phone modem is that it creates a new IP address everytime you log in. Therefore, anyone who connects to the Net via a phone modem is potentially at risk when they are logged on, but the danger of a new attack upon security disappears as soon as they log off. On the other hand, boardband offers 24/7 continuous access to Internet. As a result, the risk of being hack is greater despite the fact that the speed is much faster. Therefore, if we can create a new way to access Internet with high speed and constantly changing IP address, online security can be improved.
