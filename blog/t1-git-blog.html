        Version control is a system that records a file or set of files overtime and you can recall specific versions later. In other words, it takes a snapshot of a file at a specific moment when a change is made so that you can always go back to a version of the file at a specific moment.

        Imagine that you are working on a Microsoft Word file. There are only two choices you have while you edit it. First, you overwrite the file every time you save it. Another choice would be saving multiple versions in case you want to discard the changes you saved. Git helps us to save this trouble by taking and keeping “snapshots” of every point in time in the history. Therefore, we don’t need to worry about losing or overwriting previous versions.

        There are three reasons why people use GitHub to store my code. First, it is easy to set up connection between remote repo on GitHub and local repo on personal computer. Secondly, it is easy to set the license for your codes. Thirdly, it provides a place for programmers to save their codes online. Therefore, they will be able to access their code anytime, anywhere as long as there is Internet. Fourthly, GitHub makes it easier for programmers to collaborate remotely. Even in different parts of the world, teammates will be able to view changes that others make and merge the changes into the projects smoothly. Fifthly, GitHub is one of biggest “social media tool” for tech community. Therefore, programmers will be able to expose their works to more audience and gain more help.
