        Ruby's arrays and hashes are indexed collections. Both store collections of objects, accessible using a key. With arrays, the key is an integer, while any objects can be keys for Hashes. Both arrays and hashes grow as needed to hold new elements. It's more efficient to access array elements, but hashes provide more flexibility. Any particular array or hash can hold objects of differing types; they can contain an integer, a string, and a floating-point number.

        <span>Array</span>. Array is a list of objects bounded by a pair of square brackets. Users can access any objects in the array easily through index number, which starts from 0 instead of 1.

    <p class="blogbody">
        <span>Hash</span>. Hash is similarly to Array, but there is couple of small differences. First, hashes use a pair of braces. Secondly, while building a hash, two objects have to be supplied for every entry: one for the key, one for the value. Users access values through keys.

        Even though these two are very similar, hashes are usually more flexible normally. We can imagine that when we set up a database for user information, hash would be a very handy tool since we can access user information based on they names.
