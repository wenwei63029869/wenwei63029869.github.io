        <h2>Asking Good Questions</h2>
        <h6>By <name>Wei Wen</name> on September 24, 2016.</h6>

        <p>
            No matter what industry you are in, it is very likely that you will run into problems sooner or later. Therefore, utilizing the talents in the community of your area is essential to help you get through those problems smoothly. Posting your questions online is one of most common ways to look for help in programming community. However, we will be surprised how many people don't really know how to post a good question. In this article, we will discuss what are the criteria for a good question post.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The Golden Rule: Imagine You're Trying To Answer The Question</li>
            <li>Make sure your post include language version, platform version, operating system if it is relevant, Any other relevant software (e.g. database type and version, the IDE you're using, web server you're connecting to), any other constraints, and most importantly, do research on solutions before you post the question. </li>
            <li>Make sure it's obvious what you're trying to get out of the question.</li>
            <li>Make sure it is simple and easy to be complied if you are going to include code in your post.</li>
            <li>Make sure your spelling, grammer, formatting are correct.</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the answers you recieve. If they are not what you want, you either explain politely to them why or go back to your question and check if it is clear enough.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Example:</p>
        <p>
            Week 2 CSS Positioning Challenge question:
            How can I get my element inspector workspace to look like the one in the DBC example screenshots?

            Check out the pic and see how my styling isn't inline? I can't add a background color within the &lt;div&gt; tag... ﻿
        </p>
        <img class = "example" src="example.png"/>
        <p>
            In this post from DBC Google+ community, it achieves most of the criteria of being a good question post. Firstly, as a reader reading this post, I have no trouble to understand (although she didn't show what the correct answer should look like, the viewers should all know that because we are doing the same assignment). Also, she states clearly what she expect the outcome to be. In addition, she also include a picture to illustrate what the question is and where it occurs, which greatly help the viewers to figure out the real problem quickly.
        </p>
        <p>
            I realize that many of the questions I posted before didn't fit a lot of criteria. From now on, I have a clear guideline of how to write a good question post. Hopefully, you benefit from this post too.
